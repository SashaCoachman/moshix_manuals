It is 20-FEB-2019 at 09:17.
Enter a question mark (?) at any time for help.

* Are you satisfied with the backup of your system disk [YES]? 

Please mount the first volume of the set on DUA3:.

%VMSINSTAL-I-RESTORE, Restoring product saveset A...


	This kit contains Version 4.7 of VAX/VMS.  It must be installed 
	upon Version 4.6 of VAX/VMS.  

	NOTE:   Among the new images shipped in this kit are
		PEDRIVER.MSKEXE and DSDRIVER.MSKEXE.  If your
		system is running LAVc or volume shadowing 
		software, you MUST reapply the LAVC or volume 
		shadowing key(s) AFTER applying the Version 4.7 
		update.  If you do not reapply the appropriate keys,
		your system will not be running the updated
		images.



The first phase of the upgrade will attempt to verify that all Digital
supplied accounts are secured against obvious penetration attempts.

%UPGRADE-I-PWD_OKAY, account password for SYSTEM verified
%UPGRADE-I-PWD_OKAY, account password for FIELD verified
%UPGRADE-I-PWD_OKAY, account password for SYSTEST verified

%UPGRADE-W-PWD_INVALID, account password for SYSTEST_CLIG is invalid
-UPGRADE-I-PWD_WEAK, password is too easy to guess

Because of the preceding error, you must take action to secure this account.
You must either disable this account, change its password, or do both.

* Do you want to disable the account [YES]? NO
* Do you want to change the account password [YES]? 


You must now select a new primary password for the SYSTEST_CLIG account.  The
password you select must be at least 8 characters in length and may not
be the same as the name of the account.

New password: 
Verification: 

%UAF-I-MDFYMSG, user record(s) updated
%UPGRADE-I-PWD_SET, primary password for account SYSTEST_CLIG set

%UPGRADE-I-NONEXIST, account USER does not exist
%UPGRADE-I-NONEXIST, account USERP does not exist
